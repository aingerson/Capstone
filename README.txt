Questions for Allen:

- Distance between objects (same line? within X number of words? etc)
- Compound objects/determining entire significant object
- Utility/abilities of final product
- What patterns are important to identify?


Main chunks of this project:

1. Parsing text/identifying single metaphors (create edges)
2. Building graph/data structure to connect metaphors (shortest path and other applicable algorithms to graph)
3. User interface and functionality


Timeline

2 weeks --> Understanding metaphors/developing plan and data structure to apply later

Check-in 1 : 2/8

3 weeks --> Parsing and applying some algorithm for identify metaphors

Check-in 2 : 3/7

3 weeks --> Algorithms for detecting patterns

Check-in 3 : 4/4

2 weeks --> GUI / User functionality

Check-in 4 (last): 4/25

2 weeks (reading period and finals) --> final touches and write-up

Final project done : 5/13





proximity in text as variable

quantify loops --> shortest/longest, number of loops


circuits and paths

Line as a data structure?

Click on line and read whole poem






2/5 goals:
- optimize loading and searching
- while scanning, build graph nodes to display
- dragging lines to playground (right) / clickable adding to dynamic graph
- insignificant words
- scrolling



3/4 issues:
- scrolling tree --> TORI
- load tree in center --> TORI (done)
- drawing new tree --> TORI (done)
- change edge/node color when clicked/expanded --> TORI

- highlighting of words --> ALEXIA
- uploading poems faster --> ALEXIA


3/4 goals:
- clickable edges
- delete edges/nodes
- line density?
- keep track of edges already in tree



4/8
- trash icon becomes unclickable?
- deletion of leaves only
- coordinate bug -- FIXED
- graph has words and nodes -- JUST WORDS
- optimize poem viewing
- clicking on links highlights words too




4/14
Bugs:
- trash icon sometimes unclickable -- TORI
- tree snapping to corner -- TORI


- moving word -- ALEXIA
- invisible word -- ALEXIA
- tree deletion first word -- ALEXIA

??
- Tori's weird snapping corner



Extensions:

- optimization of poem display -- TORI
- highlighting of words -- TORI

- clear graph -- ALEXIA
- change distance and significant words -- ALEXIA
- file load only text -- ALEXIA
- deleting from graph -- ALEXIA
- saving the state/loading -- ALEXIA


- play with graphing variables -- TBD modes?
- graphing algorithms -- TBD
- UNDO Button
- Lock nodes
- general user interface -- LATER TOGETHER
- code cleanup
