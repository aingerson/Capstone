Questions for Allen:

- Distance between objects (same line? within X number of words? etc)
- Compound objects/determining entire significant object
- Utility/abilities of final product
- What patterns are important to identify?


Main chunks of this project:

1. Parsing text/identifying single metaphors (create edges)
2. Building graph/data structure to connect metaphors (shortest path and other applicable algorithms to graph)
3. User interface and functionality


Timeline

2 weeks --> Understanding metaphors/developing plan and data structure to apply later

Check-in 1 : 2/8

3 weeks --> Parsing and applying some algorithm for identify metaphors

Check-in 2 : 3/7

3 weeks --> Algorithms for detecting patterns

Check-in 3 : 4/4

2 weeks --> GUI / User functionality

Check-in 4 (last): 4/25

2 weeks (reading period and finals) --> final touches and write-up

Final project done : 5/13





proximity in text as variable

quantify loops --> shortest/longest, number of loops


circuits and paths

Line as a data structure?

Click on line and read whole poem






2/5 goals:
- optimize loading and searching
- while scanning, build graph nodes to display
- dragging lines to playground (right) / clickable adding to dynamic graph
- insignificant words
- scrolling
