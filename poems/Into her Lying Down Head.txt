Into her Lying Down Head

I

            Into her lying down head
            His enemies entered bed,
      Under the encumbered eyelid,
Through the rippled drum of the hair-buried ear;
And Noah's rekindled now unkind dove
            Flew man-bearing there.
      Last night in a raping wave
      Whales unreined from the green grave
In fountains of origin gave up their love,
      Along her innocence glided
Jaun aflame and savagely young King Lear,
            Queen Catherine howling bare
            And Samson drowned in his hair,
The colossal intimacies of silent
      Once seen strangers or shades on a stair;
There the dark blade and wanton sighing her down
To a haycock couch and the scythes of his arms
            Rode and whistled a hundred times
            Before the crowing morning climbed;
Man was the burning England she was sleep-walking, and the enamouring island
      Made her limbs blind by luminous charms,
Sleep to a newborn sleep in a swaddling loin-leaf stroked and sang
      And his runaway beloved childlike laid in the acorned sand.

            There where a numberless tongue
            Wound their room with a male moan,
      His faith around her flew undone
And darkness hung the walls with baskets of snakes,
A furnace-nostrilled column-membered
            Super-or-near man
      Resembling to her dulled sense
      The thief of adolescence,
Early imaginary half remembered
      Oceanic lover alone
Jealousy cannot forget for all her sakes,
            Made his bad bed in her good
            Night, and enjoyed as he would.
Crying, white gowned, from the middle moonlit stages
      Out to the tiered and hearing tide,
Close and far she announced the theft of the heart
In the taken body at many ages,
            Trespasser and broken bride
            Celebrating at her side
All blood-signed assailing and vanished marriages in which he had no lovely part
      Nor could share, for his pride, to the least
Mutter and foul wingbeat of the solemnizing nightpriest
Her holy unholy hours with the always anonymous beast.

            Two sand grains together in bed,
            Head to heaven-circling head,
      Singly lie with the whole wide shore,
The covering sea their nightfall with no names;
And out of every domed and soil-based shell
            One voice in chains declaims
      The female, deadly, and male
      Libidinous betrayal,
Golden dissolving under the water veil.
      A she bird sleeping brittle by
Her lover's wings that fold to-morrow's flight,
            Within the nested treefork
            Sings to the treading hawk
Carrion, paradise, chirrup my bright yolk.
      A blade of grass longs with the meadow,
A stone lies lost and locked in the lark-high hill.
Open as to the air to the naked shadow
            O she lies alone and still,
            Innocent between two wars,
With the incestuous secret brother in the seconds to perpetuate the stars,
      A man torn up mourns in the sole night.
And the second comers, the severers, the enemies from the deep
Forgotten dark, rest their pulse and bury their dead in her faithless sleep.
